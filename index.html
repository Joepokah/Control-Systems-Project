    <p>What we learned</p>

    <ul> <!-- changed to list in the tutorial -->
      <li>How to build and model basic systems in VREP</li>
      <li>Integration of different components</li>
      <li>Analyzing results</li>
    </ul>

    <p> This was a very challenging project for us, but we were able to make great progress. We will need to continue to develop these skills in the future.</p>
